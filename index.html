  <figure>
    <p>Feelin' my way through the darkness <br>
      Guided by a beatin' heart <br>
      I can't tell where the journey will end <br>
      But I know where to start <br>
      They tell me I'm too young to understand <br>
      They say I'm caught up in a dream <br>
      Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes <br>
      Well, that's fine by me</p>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <p>So wake me up when it's all over <br>
      When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
      All this time, I was findin' myself and I <br>
      Didn't know I was lost <br>
      So wake me up when it's all over <br>
      When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
      All this time, I was findin' myself and I <br>
      Didn't know I was lost</p>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <p>I tried carryin' the weight of the world <br>
      But I only have two hands <br>
      Hope I get the chance to travel the world <br>
      But I don't have any plans <br>
      Wish that I could stay forever this young <br>
      Not afraid to close my eyes <br>
      Life's a game made for everyone <br>
      And love is the prize</p>      
  </figure>

    <p>
      So wake me up when it's all over <br>
      When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
      All this time, I was findin' myself and I <br>
      Didn't know I was lost <br>
      So wake me up when it's all over <br>
      When I'm wiser and I'm older <br>
      All this time, I was findin' myself and I <br>
      I didn't know I was lost

      I didn't know I was lost <br>
      I didn't know I was lost <br>
      I didn't know I was lost <br>
      I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know
