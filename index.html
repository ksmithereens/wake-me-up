      <p>Feelin' my way through the darkness
        Guided by a beatin' heart
        I can't tell where the journey will end
        But I know where to start
        They tell me I'm too young to understand
        They say I'm caught up in a dream
        Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
        Well, that's fine by me</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>So wake me up when it's all over
        When I'm wiser and I'm older
        All this time, I was findin' myself and I
        Didn't know I was lost
        So wake me up when it's all over
        When I'm wiser and I'm older
        All this time, I was findin' myself and I
        Didn't know I was lost</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>I tried carryin' the weight of the world
        But I only have two hands
        Hope I get the chance to travel the world
        But I don't have any plans
        Wish that I could stay forever this young
        Not afraid to close my eyes
        Life's a game made for everyone
        And love is the prize</p>      
    </figure>

      <p>
        So wake me up when it's all over
        When I'm wiser and I'm older
        All this time, I was findin' myself and I
        Didn't know I was lost
        So wake me up when it's all over
        When I'm wiser and I'm older
        All this time, I was findin' myself and I
        I didn't know I was lost
      </p>

    <figure>
      <p>
        I didn't know I was lost
        I didn't know I was lost
        I didn't know I was lost
        I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know
